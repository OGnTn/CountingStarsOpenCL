# Counting stars in Python

This folder contains a Python implementation of the Counting Stars project.

## How to run

To run the Python script, you first need to install the dependencies, preferably in a virtual environment:

```sh
# In this directory:
# Create a new virtual environment in the folder venv:
$ python3 -m venv venv
# Activate the virtual environment in the current shell session:
$ source venv/bin/activate
# Install the dependencies:
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Every time you create a new terminal session, you'll need to activate the virtual environment first:

```sh
$ source venv/bin/activate
# You can now run:
$ python main.py
```

This project depends on:

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) to create and manipulate matrices.
* [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) to load, manipulate, and save images.
